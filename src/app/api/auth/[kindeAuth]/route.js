// import { handleAuth } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/server";:

// This line imports the handleAuth function from the Kinde package, specifically for the server-side in a Next.js application. Kinde is an identity and access management solution similar to Auth0, which provides authentication and authorization services.
// export const GET = handleAuth();:

// Here, handleAuth() is being used to create a handler for the GET request.
// handleAuth is a function that wraps the authentication logic into the route. This effectively means that any request made to this API route will go through the authentication flow defined by Kinde.
// If the user is authenticated, they are granted access. If they are not, the function will typically return an appropriate response (like a redirect to a login page or an error response).
// This setup allows you to easily protect server-side routes with authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.
